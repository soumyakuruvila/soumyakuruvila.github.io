 <h2>Welcome!</h2>
 	<p>
	I am a high school student in the Academy of the Advancement of Science and Technology (AAST) in 
	<a href="http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php/bergen-county-academies?layout=blog" target="_blank">
	Bergen County Academies</a>, Hackensack, NJ. Just a little bit about me. I have lived in India, UAE, Canada, and now 
	the United States. I am currently a rising senior and am looking forward to my last year in high school. I am into many 
	things including music and sports. I play the flute and learning how to play the piano. I also enjoy to play both basketball
	and soccer and currently play for the school tennis team. I hope to go into EECS or Electrical Engineering and Computer 
	Science in college because I am extremely interested in the field. I feel it has extreme promise for the future and will 
	lead to many innovations of the future. Below are my classes, some of my skills & projects, and a few extracurriclurs I reguraly 
	participate in.

<h4>  Mechatronics Research - The FlexShoe </h4>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pk1ps_jPfhs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> The FlexShoe is a product for those who are suffering from foot swelling. 
This product relieves the pain by using a mechanism constructed within the shoe, that is able to spread the area in the front of the 
shoe so that there is more space for the swollen foot. Many people suffer from swollen feet and face difficulties with outdoor 
activities primarily because their shoe is tight and uncomfortable. As a solution to this problem, we have come up with the idea to 
make the FlexShoe which offers the option to adjust the width of the shoe to fit a swollen foot. This helps because an average 
shoe causes pain due to the enormous amount of pressure applied to the swollen parts of your foot by your shoe. 
Inside our revolutionized shoe, arduino motors and gears are installed and are able to adjust the width of the shoe to provide space
 and increase comfortability for your foot. The inside of the shoe will be modified with memory foam to offer extra comfort. 
This way the shoe will conform to the shape of your foot and it won&rsquo;t be as uncomfortable. As of 2012, 29.1 percent of Americans
 suffer from diabetes. Also, other diseases that cause foot swelling include Lymphedema, Venous Insufficiency and ankle/foot injuries.
 In addition, pregnancies are one of the main causes for swelling of the foot as well. The FlexShoe will be able to target a large 
percentage of customers who suffer  from foot swelling and will be available in an affordable price range as well as many different 
sizes. The FlexShoe is a revolutionary innovation and will help millions of people worldwide. No longer will it be a pain to walk in your shoe.

<h4> Nanotechnology Research - Lithium Ion Battery </h4>

<p>

The name of my research project is the <i> The Use of Fluoride treated Silicon Nanoparticles for 
a better Lithium Ion Batttery. </i> I conducted this research by myself under the mentorship of
Dr. Kim. I began this research during my sophomore year of high school and have since one a medal
from the Office of Naval Research at the New Jersey Regional Science Fair. This research was 
conducted in order to develop a high quality Lithium Ion battery through the use of Fluoride Treated 
Silicon Pedot PSS. Solutions of Silicon Pedot PSS were synthesized through repetitive processes of filtering 
and centrifuging. HF was later added to increase conductivity of the solution by reacting with the 
Silicon Dioxide that coated and protected the silicon nanoparticles. The solutions will be coated 
on to anodes and measured for power performance which was higher than a normal lithium ion battery. 
By adding the silicon to the solution, the overall conductivity is increased, thereby increasing the 
conductivity of the battery. In the end, this research will provide a better, more-powerful compact battery.

<h4> FIRST Robotics - Team 6203 </h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics</a> or <i> For Inspiration 
and Recognition of Science and Technology </i> is a robotics competetion recognized globally. It includes 
several competitions including the FIRST Lego League, the FIRST Tech Challenge and the FIRST Robotics Competition.  
There are more than 6000 teams worldwide and this past year our school started a FIRST Robotics team at 
our school. We are the Titanium Knights Team 6203, strong and proud. The FIRST Robotics Competition required an extremely 
rigorous amount of work and commitment from our entire team. Every year, a new challenge must be completed by a robot 
constructed in six weeks. Last year&rsquo;s theme was FIRST Stronghold, where we had to build a robot capable of conquering 
several obstacles in order to capture and siege a tower. An extensive rulebook is published at the beginning of the 
season which specificies the do&rsquo;s and dont&rsquo;s of the competition. Creating a robot able to accomplish the task but 
also follow the rules is a tall task, but we were able to do it, successfully at that, as rookies. Rookies generally don&rsquo;t 
accomplish as much as we did this past season. The year began with weeks of preparation leading up to the competition reveal 
signaling the beginning of the season. We had to secure sponsors, equipment, and mentors, all crucial to the team. When the 
competition was revealed, preparation began as we began to build a robot. We split into teams to maximize efficiency - Design, Sofware 
Build, Finance, Social Relations. There were many setbacks, trips to Home Depot and Lowe&rsquo;s, and arguments galore. But, we all 
knew the final goal and all wanted to get there, together. After weeks, we finally had a design we could all agree on and feasibly build 
with the available equipment and budget. 6 weeks turned to 5 and 2. We began to see the outline of a robot and were elated at 
the process. But, there was a complication. After looking over the design and math, some of us saw a possible problem with the 
gear box. There was a slight miscalculation, but we couldn&rsquo;t be sure whether it would affect the outcome. We had enough members 
working on the primary, that we were able to sacrifice a team of little less than 10 to work on a backup bot. It was a simple design 
and would be primarily geared for defense. 2 became 1 and 1 became a little less than 2 days. I remember the day. We had just finished 
the primary bot and set it on its first test run. It failed. We checked and checked, but we couldn't fix the problem in less than 24 hours. 
We voted and knew what the sensbible thing to do was. we took the backup bot to the competion, all low on fumes. We didnrsquo;t expect 
much from the <i> The Millenium Defalcon </i> (Named after our teacher), but we nonetheless gave it all we got. Defense was our identity, 
and we were darn good at it. We became recognized as a Defensive Specialist, leading with our teams to two District Event Championships and 
eventually the MAR District Championships, not to mention a Rookie All-star award. This was extremely rare for a rookie. We all reflected 
on the season with high hopes for the next. We knew we weren&rsquo;t done.</p>

<a name="ExtraC"></a> <h3> Extracurriculurs </h3>
<h4> Tennis Team </h4>

I&rsquo;ve been playing tennis since I got into it in the 6th grade. My dad took me to the US Open Tournament 
that summer and I really got into tennis after that. I became a huge fan of Stan Wawrinka and Federer, and started
attending clinics through the fall and winter. I joined the USTA where I played challenge matches against some of 
the best players in Bergen County and other parts of the tri-state area. When I came to BCA, I knew I wanted to join 
the tennis team and have been a part of it since freshemen year. I am currently the JV captain and often play varsity 
games. I love the game of tennis because it inspires me to be at my best, and the feeling I get when I step on to the 
court is unparalleled.

<h4> Math Team </h4>

In middle school, I was apart of my middle school math team where we participated in MathCounts competition. In 8th grade
we ranked 3rd in the County and I ranked 11 overall. We went to the state competition, something our school had never done. 
When I came into BCA, I knew I wanted to join the Math team at BCA. They had won numerous national competitions. Every year I 
participate at the ARML comepetition and last year I traveled to San Franciso with my team to participate in the competition at 
U. Cal. Berkley. 

<h4> Clubs </h4>
<ul>
	<li> Basketball Club - President </li>
	<li> South Asian Club - Treasurer </li>
	<li> Foster the Children - Vice President </li>
</ul>
<h4> Hindu Samaj Mandir </h4>

My heritage and my culture is a huge part of my life. My parents and I were both born in India, the difference being 
they were raised there and I was raised here. When we moved here, and joined the family at the Hindu Simaj Mandir 
I never knew where it would take me. I am a part of a project known as the Museaum of India Journey where we interview varoius 
people of Indian heritage and record their journey to the states. We have interviewed over 50 people and will continue to 
interview numerous more.

<h4> Rotary Club of Riverside Pune </h4>

During the summer of 2015, I traveled to India to make a difference. Disease, infestation, and infection are all rife in 
the rural parts of India, mainly because of a lack of toilets. I joined the Rotary Club of Riverside Pune and began a 
toilet project. We created a inexpensive easy instalation toilet that could be installed in the most remote parts of India. While I was there, 
we installed more than 500 toilets in more than 20 villages across the southern part of India. I continue working with the Club from 
here and keep in touch. The work they are doing there is life-changing for a lot of people and really making a difference.

<h4> Taikwando and Jiu-Jitsu </h4>

For the past 5 years I have been taking classes in Taikwando and Jiu-Jitsu at the American Martial arts and Sef-Defense Academy. I am 
currenly a second-degree black belt and am skilled in Jiu-Jitsu as well. I also have become skilled in the arts of grappling and self-defense 
techniques. I currently volunteer and teach kids these techniques first hand as they may need it in the real world. In the following months 
I hope to achieve the rank of thir-degree black belt.
